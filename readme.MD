# Gover - Government-Verified Coverage for All Citizens

## Problem Statement
In Malaysia, there is a growing concern that some low-income B40 households might be misusing government resources. Current incentive platforms are often slow and lack transparency, making it difficult to ensure that aid reaches the intended recipients. **GoVer** addresses these issues by introducing an AI-powered blockchain platform. By integrating **Aptos blockchain technology** with a **Large Language Model (LLM) chatbot**, we create a user-friendly experience that simplifies web3 for all Malaysians. Our platform ensures transparency and accountability while maintaining a clean and accessible interface, even for those with minimal web3 knowledge.

## Key Features
- **Blockchain Integration:** Ensures transparency, immutability, and verifiability of all transactions.
- **AI-Powered Chatbot:** Provides assistance and guides users through the platform, making it easy to interact with web3 technologies.
- **Third-Party Collaboration:** Open platform for everyone to contribute. SME businesses, NGOs, and individuals can participate by offering additional services, incentives, or products to users. This collaboration enriches the user experience and adds value to the incentives offered by the government.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Designed to be intuitive and accessible to all Malaysians, including those with little to no experience with blockchain or web3.
