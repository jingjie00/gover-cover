# **Gover** - Government-Verified Coverage for All Citizens

In Malaysia, there is a growing concern that some low-income B40 households might be misusing government resources. Current incentive platforms are often slow and lack transparency, making it difficult to ensure that aid reaches the intended recipients. **GoVer** addresses these issues by introducing an AI-powered blockchain platform. By integrating **Aptos blockchain technology** with a **Large Language Model (LLM) chatbot**, we create a user-friendly experience that simplifies web3 for all Malaysians. Our platform ensures transparency and accountability while maintaining a clean and accessible interface, even for those with minimal web3 knowledge.

## Key Features
- **Blockchain Integration:** Ensures transparency, immutability, and verifiability of all transactions.
- **AI-Powered Chatbot:** Provides assistance and guides users through the platform, making it easy to interact with web3 technologies.
- **Third-Party Collaboration:** Open platform for everyone to contribute. SME businesses, NGOs, and individuals can participate by offering additional services, incentives, or products to users. This collaboration enriches the user experience and adds value to the incentives offered by the government.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Designed to be intuitive and accessible to all Malaysians, including those with little to no experience with blockchain or web3.

## Addressing the Issues
Malaysia currently faces significant challenges in the distribution of government incentives, particularly in terms of speed, transparency, and efficiency. The Governance, Transparency, and Integrity (GTI) Index for Malaysian organizations is notably low at 10, compared to Singapore's 75. This discrepancy highlights the need for better governance practices, as demonstrated in a study by Lokman, N., Othman, S., & Mohd Kamal, N. (2023) titled Governance, Accountability, and Transparency Level of Non-Profit Organisation: A Study Of Malaysian Foundations International Journal of Business and Technology Management.

In addition, the current system for distributing incentives, such as the B40 student online course incentives, faces several inefficiencies. To address these challenges, GoVer has opted against lump-sum payments or claim-based assistance. Instead, we utilize AI to enhance the efficiency of the approval process. This approach addresses common issues associated with lump-sum payments, such as delayed approvals and misuse of funds, as highlighted in the study by Khullar, D., Bond, A. M., Oâ€™Donnell, E. M., Qian, Y., Gans, D. N., & Casalino, L. P. (2021) on Time and financial costs for physician practices to participate in the Medicare merit-based incentive payment system: a qualitative study JAMA Health Forum.

By leveraging AI, GoVer accelerates the approval process, ensuring that funds are allocated efficiently and used for their intended purposes. This approach not only speeds up the distribution of incentives but also improves the overall effectiveness of government programs.

## How Aptos Blockchain Solves These Problems
1. **Transparency and Accountability**:
By integrating Aptos blockchain technology into the **GoVer** platform, we ensure that every transaction is recorded immutably and publicly verifiable. This enhances transparency, allowing both the government and the public to track the distribution of incentives. Taxpayers can see how their money is being spent, ensuring that funds are used wisely and effectively.

2. **Efficiency in Distribution**:
The integration of AI with blockchain technology helps to streamline the approval process for incentive claims. Every account on the platform has its own quota, and the AI acts as a primary filter to automatically approve applications within this quota. This reduces the processing time and minimizes the risk of human error or bias in the approval process.

3. **Preventing Misuse of Funds**:
To prevent the misuse of incentives, the platform ties the disbursement of funds to specific purposes. For example, B40 students who receive online course incentives will be required to use the funds only for approved educational expenses. The blockchain provides a clear, auditable trail of how the funds are used, ensuring they go towards their intended purpose.
